<p align="center">
Foodbook is a personal project that I have been working on as a hobby in order to explore my interest in app development. It is a social media app which makes use of Google Places API
to find restaurants nearby, provide details on those restaurants (e.g. rating, reviews) and list which restaurants friends are going to. A significant part of this work has involved self-learning
a new language (JavaScript) and frameworks (React Native), in addition to researching and implementing Firebase Authentication and a RealTime Database.
